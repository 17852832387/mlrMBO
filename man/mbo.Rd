\usage{
mbo(fun, par.set, design = NULL, learner, control, show.info = TRUE,
  more.args = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{fun}{[\code{function(x, ...)}]\cr
Fitness function to minimize. The first argument has to be a list of values.
The function has to return a single numerical value.
In fact it is possible to return even more information which will be stored
in the optimization path. To achieve this, simply append the attribute \dQuote{extras}
to the return value of the target function. This has to be a named list of scalar values.
Each of these values will be stored additionally in the optimization path.}

\item{par.set}{[\code{\link[ParamHelpers]{ParamSet}}]\cr
See \code{\link{mbo}}.}

\item{design}{[\code{data.frame} | NULL]\cr
Initial design as data frame.
If the parameters have corresponding trafo functions,
the design must not be transformed before it is passed!
If \code{NULL}, one is constructed from the settings in \code{control}.}

\item{learner}{[\code{\link[mlr]{Learner}}]\cr
Regression learner to model \code{fun}.}

\item{control}{[\code{\link{MBOControl}}]\cr
Control object for mbo.}

\item{show.info}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Verbose output on console?
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{more.args}{[list]\cr
Further arguments passed to fitness function.}

\description{
It is possible to parallelize the evaluation of the target function to speed up the computation.
Internally the evaluation of the target function is realized with the R package parallelMap.
See the mlrMBO tutorial and the Github project pages of parallelMap for instructions
on how to set up parallelization.
Currently the following operations are performed in parallel, if parallelization is switched on:
\itemize{
\item{Evaluation of the initial design.}
\item{Evaluation of multiple proposed points in one iteration (if multiple are proposed).}
\item{Model fitting of multiple models and optimization of multiple infill criteria.}
}
Details regarding the last point above:
\describe{
\item{Singlecrit MBO with 1 point proposal}{No further parallelization.}
\item{Singlecrit MBO with LCB multipointi}{Parallel optimization of LCBs for multiple lambda.}
}
